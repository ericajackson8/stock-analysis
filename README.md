# Stock-analysis
Module 2 VBA Challenge
## Overview of Project
In this project our goal was to provide stock performance information on other green energy stocks for Steve's parents.  Up til now, his parents have been investing primarily in DAQO and Steve believes they should diversify across other green energy companies.  Our analysis will help them to see performance of other green energy companies so they can see how it compares with their current investment with the hopes that they will diversify their investments.
## Results
### Comparison of Stock Performance
In 2017, all but one of the green enery stocks shows an increas in performance.<img width="249" alt="Stock_Performance_2017" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56225030/205451127-ebb8fe5b-aede-49b5-9037-b8821c1c0f74.png">  In fact, the DAQO company, stocker ticker DQ, had the best performance with 199.4% return on the stock price. In 2018 most of the stocks fell in price, except ENPH and RUN.<img width="250" alt="Stock_Performance_2018" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56225030/205451691-70e36b3c-630a-4051-9c2c-d8049d052d35.png">. Although DQ did not completely return to the starting price in 2017, it did lose about 62% of its value.  Again, this is another good reason for Steve's parents to diversify their portfolio.  
I would highly recommend looking at the ENPH stock.  Although the stock price is relatively low comared with DQ, the stock increased in 2017 and again in 2017, for another 81%.  Again, the price is lower which means that they could invest at a higher volume.  

### Comparison of Code Performance
The original VB code that primarily used a nested loop to summarize volumes and return on price ran at approximately 36,000 cpu seconds for both years; whereas, the refactored code only took .09 and .06 cpu secods for 2017 and 2018, respectively.
